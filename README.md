# Functional Programming in Scala - by Example

## Purpose

### Functionally

1. Cover functional programming from principles
2. Document FP concepts in a semantically rich way
3. Demonstrate FP concepts through implementations from [a number of frameworks and other sources](#resources)
4. Cross reference between code and FP concepts in order to strengthen the understanding
5. Cross reference between code and FP concepts and resources for the same reason (longer term)

### Technically

1. Determine if [Specs2] is indeed a net superior way to do [literate programming] in Scala when compared with [Scalatex], [Tut], [Dotlit], [Literator] and [Docco]
